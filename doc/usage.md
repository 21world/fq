### Basic usage

fq tries to behave the same way as jq as much as possible, so you can do:
```
fq . file.mp3
fq < file.mp3
fq . < file.mp3
fq . *.png *.jpg
fq '.frames[0]' file.mp3
```

### Interactive REPL

fq has an interactive [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
with auto completion and nested REPL support:

```
# start REPL with null input
fq -i
# same as
fq -ni
# start REPL with one file as input
fq -i . file.mp3
```

In the REPL you will see a prompt indicating current input and you can type jq expression to evaluate.

```
# basic arithmetics
mp3> 1+1
2
# "." is the identity function, returns current input, the mp3 file.
mp3> .
# access the first frame in the mp3 file
mp3> .frames[0]
# start a new REPl with first frame as input
mp3> .frames[0] | repl
```

Use Ctrl-C to exits REPL, Ctrl-C to interrupt current evaluation.

## Langauge

fq is based on the [jq language](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and for basic usage its syntax
is similar to how object and array access looks in JavaScript or JSON path, `.food[10]` etc.

To get the most out of fq it's recommended to learn more about jq, here are some good starting points:

- [jq manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/)
- [jq Cookbook](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki/Cookbook),
[FAQ](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki/FAQ),
[Pitfalls](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki/How-to:-Avoid-Pitfalls)

The most common beginner gotcha is probably jq's use of `;` and `,`. jq uses `;` as argument separator
and `,` as output separator.
To call `f` with two arguments use `f(a; b)`. If you do `f(a, b)` you pass a single
argument `a, b` to `f`.

### Basics

TODO

### Differences to jq

- [gojq's differences to jq](https://github.com/itchyny/gojq#difference-to-jq),
notable is support for arbitrary-precision integers.
- Supports hexdecimal `0xab`, octal `0o77` and binary `0b101` integer literals
- Has bitwise operations, `band`, `bor`, `bxor`, `bsl`, `bsr`, `bnot`
- Try include `include "file?";` that don't fail if file is missing
- Possible for a value to act as a object with keys even when it's an array, number etc.
- There can be keys hidden from `keys` and `[]`. Used for, `_format`, `_bytes` etc.
- Some values do not support to be updated

### Functions

- All standard library functions from jq
  - `streaks/0`, `streaks_by/1` like `group` but groups streaks based on condition.
  - `count`, `count_by/1` like `group` but counts groups lengths.
  - `debug/1` like `debug/0` but uses arg to produce debug message. `{a: 123} | debug({a}) | ...`.
  - `path_to_expr` from `["key", 1]` to `".key[1]"`.
  - `expr_to_path` from `".key[1]"` to `["key", 1]`.
  - `diff/2` produce diff object between two values.
  - `delta`, `delta_by/1`, array with difference between all consecutive pairs.
  - `chunk/1`, split array or string into even chunks
- `open` open file for reading
- `probe` or `decode` probe format and decode
- `mp3`, `matroska`, ..., `<name>`, `decode([name])` force decode as format
- `d`/`display` display value and truncate long arrays
- `f`/`full` display value and don't truncate arrays
- `v`/`verbose` display value verbosely and don't truncate array
- `p`/`preview` show preview of field tree
- `hd`/`hexdump` hexdump value
- `repl` nested REPL, must be last in a pipeline. `1 | repl` or "slurp" multiple outputs `1, 2, 3 | repl`.

### Decoded values (TODO: better name?)

When you decode something successfully in fq you will get a value. A value work a bit like
jq object with special abilities and is used to represent a tree structure of the decoded
binary data. Each value always has a name, type and a bit range.

A value has these special keys:

- `_name` name of value
- `_value` jq value of value
- `_start` bit range start
- `_stop` bit range stop
- `_len` bit range length (TODO: rename)
- `_bits` bits in range as a binary
- `_bytes` bits in range as binary using byte units
- `_path` jq path to value
- `_unknown` value is un-decoded gap
- `_symbol` symbolic string representation of value (optional)
- `_description` longer description of value (optional)
- `_format` name of decoded format (optional)
- `_error` error message (optional)

- TODO: unknown gaps

### Binary and IO lists

- TODO: similar to erlang io lists, [], binary, string (utf8) and numbers

## Configuration

To add own functions you can use `init.fq` that will be read from
- `$HOME/Library/Application Support/fq/init.jq` on macOS
- `$HOME/.config/fq/init.jq` on Linux, BSD etc
- `%AppData%\fq\init.jq` on Windows (TODO: not tested)

## Own decoders and use as library

TODO


## Known issues and useful tricks

### Run interactive mode with no input
```sh
fq -i
null>
```

### `.. | select(...)` fails with `expected an ... but got: ...`

Try add `select(...)?` to catch type errors in the select expression.

### Manual decode

Sometimes fq fails to decode or you know there is valid data buried inside some binary or maybe
you know the format of some unknown value. Then you can decode manually.

<pre>
# try decode a `mp3_frame` that failed to decode
$ fq file.mp3 .unknown0 mp3_frame
# skip first 10 bytes then decode as `mp3_frame`
$ fq file.mp3 .unknown0._bytes[10:] mp3_frame
</pre>

### Pass `.` as input and argument

This won't work as expected `.a | f(.b)` as `.` is `.a` when evaluating the arguments.
Instead do `. as $c | .a | f($c.b)`.

### Building array is slow

Try to use `map` or `foreach` to avoid rebuilding the whole array for each append.

### Use `print` and `println` to produce more friendly compact output

```
> [[0,"a"],[1,"b"]]
[
  [
    0,
    "a"
  ],
  [
    1,
    "b"
  ]
]
> [[0,"a"],[1,"b"]] | .[] | "\(.[0]): \(.[1])" | println
0: a
1: b
```

### `repl` argument using function or variable causes `variable not defined`

`true as $verbose | repl({verbose: $verbose})` will currently fail as `repl` is
implemented by rewriting the query to  `map(true as $verbose | .) | repl({verbose: $verbose})`.

### `error` produces no output

`null | error` behaves as `empty`.
